Starting up a personal site again. Serving as an outlet for more long form personal posts as well as technical posts. Ideally you'll be able to choose the category that appeals to you. I'm a DevOps engineer in the Northern Virginia area. I'm a cyclist, a hobbyist brewer (of coffee and beer), an extremely amateur photographer, and a recovering pessimist.

More than likely there will be posts here that at times may not make a lot of sense, followed by extremely in depth posts about current topics in the DevOps world. I'm a strange person and I will make absolutely no concessions to hiding that fact. There will be photos, recipes, poetry, links to music. This site is for me. These posts will serve as a log of things I am willing to share with others, that I want recorded for posterity.

That is what you can expect from here. I may share often, or I may go weeks without posting anything. Historically I rapidly share several things in quick succession and then go on hiatus. That is how I operate with most things in my life.
